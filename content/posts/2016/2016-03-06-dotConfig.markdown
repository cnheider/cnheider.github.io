After some personal requests for the [dotfiles](https://github.com/cnHeider/dotfiles) of my setups, I have published them on github.

I am running Debian Strech, with non-free repos. My setup is minimal, I am running Openbox, Tint2, Feh and Synapse semantic launcher which in my opinion is more than enough to give you fully functional desktop environment and further more is fully customisable.

I am running my own [fork](https://github.com/cnHeider/synapse) of Synapse, which i re-themed and made some plug-ins for.

My conky configs is also included, but it is hardcoded for my 1366x756 resolution, but should be easily modifiable for any resolution.
